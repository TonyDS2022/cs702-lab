# Exercise 8.1: Linear Programming

## Introduction

We have seen how to use Pyomo, a Python library to model and solve optimization problems. Let's practice how to use this library by going through a simple intelligent UI planning problem. Consider the following scenario:

You are building an intelligent user interface for a course project. You have time to build two types of adaptive UI components:

- **Component p**: Adaptive hints / next-step suggestions (e.g., contextual tips, recommended next actions, micro-guidance).
- **Component q**: Adaptive ranking / layout (e.g., re-ordering items, ranking results, personalized feed ordering).

To build these components, you need two limited development resources:

- **m**: Engineering effort units (e.g., implementation + integration work)
- **n**: UI/content tuning effort units (e.g., copywriting, design iterations, rule tuning)

And we know the following:

- To build 1 unit of component p, you need 2 units of effort m and 4 units of effort n.
- To build 1 unit of component q, you need 4 units of effort m and 3 units of effort n.
- You have 60 units of effort m and 80 units of effort n available.
- The expected impact of 1 unit of component p is 150 points (e.g., expected improvement in user performance or satisfaction).
- The expected impact of 1 unit of component q is 200 points.

Let x be the number of units of component p that you build. And let y be the number of units of component q that you build. How much of component p and component q should you build to maximize the total expected impact?

## Q1. Modeling the Optimization Problem

Answer the following:

1. What are the design variables for this problem?
2. What is the objective function?
3. Are there any constraints? If so, describe them.

The optimization problem is formalized as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\max_{x, y}\;& 150x + 200y &\\
\text{s. t. }& 2x + 4y &\leq 60\\
& 4x + 3y &\leq 80\\
& x &\geq 0\\
& y &\geq 0
\end{aligned}
$$

## Q2. Implementation

Using your answer for Q1, translate this linear programming problem into a Pyomo code. Report the optimal values for the design variables and the profit.
