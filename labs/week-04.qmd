## Introduction

This week's lab explores the multi-armed bandit problem—a classic framework for balancing exploration and exploitation in sequential decision-making. You'll learn to formulate A/B tests using Thompson sampling with Bayesian inference.

> You are tasked with conducting a sequential A/B test of two interface designs ($i \in \{A, B\}$). Users perform a task using one of the interfaces, and we observe an outcome of either $x \in \{\text{Success}, \text{Failure}\}$.

For each interface design, we model the probability of a successful interaction $p_i$ using:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p_i &\sim \text{Beta}(1, 1) \\
x_i &\sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_i)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Q1. Deriving Posterior Distributions

Given the following observations, derive the posterior distributions of $p_A$ and $p_B$ for design A and design B.

- Design A: [Success, Failure, Success, Success, Failure]
- Design B: [Success, Success, Success, Failure, Success]


## Q2. Selecting the Next Design

Based on the posterior distributions you derived, which design would the agent more likely select for the next user? Explain your reasoning.

## Q3. Balancing Exploration and Exploitation

Suppose you need to conduct this A/B test with 1000 users in a sequential manner. Explain how Thompson sampling (or bandit algorithms in general) helps balance exploration and exploitation in this context.

## Q4. Thompson Sampling Implementation

Implement a Thompson sampling algorithm to simulate the sequential A/B test described above using NumPyro.

Requirements:
1. Initialize Beta priors for both designs A and B as Beta(1, 1)
2. For each of 1000 users:
   - Sample from the posterior distributions of $p_A$ and $p_B$
   - Select the design with the higher sampled value
   - Simulate an outcome (Success/Failure) based on the true success probabilities: $p_A = 0.4$ and $p_B = 0.6$
   - Update the posterior distribution for the selected design

After all 1000 users, report:
- The total number of times each design was selected
- The total number of successes for each design
- The final posterior distributions (alpha and beta parameters) for both designs
